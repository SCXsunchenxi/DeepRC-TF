# Deep Reservoir Computing - TensorFlow Library

TF implementation of the functionalities of Deep Reservoir Computing. 
Import the content of DeepRC.py and use the SimpleDeepReservoirLayer as the dynamical component of your deep network for time-series processing. In the code you can find an example on how to use SimpleDeepReservoirLayer to define a SimpleDeepESNClassifier.

If you use this code in your work, please cite the following paper, in which the concept of Deep Reservoir Computing has been introduced.
